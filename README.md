# Serverless backend for AWS
Webstore - a shared trainee project where I am working on backend. This excerpt is just for an example of NodeJS backend with serverless AWS Lambda functions using AuroraDB (RDS).

In the project we use also Cognito user pool authentication for accessing apis for adding, removing and editing items/products. Cognito and AuroraDB are configured via AWS Console.

Started working with this in JAN 2022 and will be working whenever there is time for it. Lots of 'to-do's and test and just 'play-around-with's.

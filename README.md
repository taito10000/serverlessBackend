# Serverless backend for AWS
Webstore - a shared trainee project where I am working on the backend and on the front end admin pages. This excerpt is just for an example of NodeJS backend with serverless AWS Lambda functions using AuroraDB (RDS) and client side Admin pages with sign in to Cognito user pool. 

Cognito user pool authentication is for accessing apis for adding, removing and editing items/products. Cognito and AuroraDB are configured via AWS Console.

Started working with this in JAN 2022 and will be working whenever there is time for it. Lots of 'to-do's and test and just 'play-around-with's.
